# Grouping_Algorithm- Python

This project was developed with the aim of categorizing tubes according to their bendability in manufacturing of curved geometry, based on experimental data.

A set of 350 tube bars (6m each) where labeled with a number and had a piece of it laser cutted and labeled with the same number.

Each numbered piece was then bent with a pre-defined bending parameters (radius and angle)

A data base was constructed to relate each bar number to it's bend radius.

The algorithm was then able to read the table and stablish which bar numbers were close to one another based on their measured bend radius, given a certain tolerance. 

From this point, the algorithm also defines which bar has the most bars with close bend radius within the tolerance and stablished this bars as "group heads".

It them exports a table containing in its first column the number of the bars that are group heads, and each row contains the bar numbers that are close to its "group head".

With this information we drastically reduced the amount of time spent setting up the bending machine for tubo with different bending properties, being able to continuosly bend tubes from a single grupo, reducing the waste generated by bending a tube with parameters that werent suitable for it.
